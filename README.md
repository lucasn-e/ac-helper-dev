# ac-helper-dev
a tiny, lazy helper for animal crossing new horizons. ugly code included.

currently hosted on https://ac-helper.com/

there is bound to be messy code since this project started absurdly small and grew way out of proportion after I gained overwhelming responses. the css is horrid since it started out within each component and was later moved as I added the scss loader.

in case you want to host it yourself, it's pretty straight forward:

`npm run serve` will run on a local development server on localhost:8080 by default
<br>
`npm run build` will build the project in the `/dist` directory which you can then host on your server if you intend to do that.

feel free to fork and play around
